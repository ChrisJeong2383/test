This lab is based on https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/05design/lab.html

For this lab I got to build a multiple-page application using React Navigation

Exercise 5 Quesitons

1.Of what benefit was the refactoring phase of this lab?
A:By doing this lab, I got to know more about how navigation works and how import/export works on react

2.What do the export commands do?
A:Export sends out user inputted data which can be used by other files by importing

3.This application uses stack navigation. What does the stack do here? What is the deepest this stack can get in this application?
A:Stack navigation in this app allowed us to switch screens by pressing touchable object. There is no limit of how deep you can go with stack navigation.
